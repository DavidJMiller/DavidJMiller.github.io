## About Me

I am a PhD student at the University of Utah's School of Computing. My advisor is [Bei Wang](http://www.sci.utah.edu/~beiwang/). My research interests lie in computational topology and algorithms. I tend to lean towards the theoretical side, by I find myself coding from time to time. My hobbies include rock climbing, ricing my Linux (currently running Manjaro), and spending time with friends.
