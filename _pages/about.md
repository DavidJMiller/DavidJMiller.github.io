I am a PhD student at the University of Utah's School of Computing. My advisor is [Bei Wang](http://www.sci.utah.edu/~beiwang/). My research interests lie in algorithms with applications to data science and machine learning. I enjoy understanding both theory and architecture and leveraging this for scalable and optimized algortihms. My favorite languages are C for making deployable code and Python for quick and dirty scripting. My hobbies include video games, rock climbing, ricing my Linux (currently running Manjaro), and spending time with friends.
